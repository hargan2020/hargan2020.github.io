        <div class="text-28">A soulmate usually only comes once in your life to shake things up, show true love, and stand up to you in ways no one else ever has. They adore you, yet challenge you to the fullest potential. A soulmate relationship isn't only peaches and creams. It's roses with throns.</div>
        <div class="text-28">True love for me is when she's the first thought that goes into head when I wake-up, and the last thought that comes before going to sleep, no matter how the day was and what we talked about. It starts and ends with prayers for both of us (and families).</div>
