        <br>
        <span class="text-28">For me, <b>Love</b> is the feeling having you near me, sometimes physically, sometimes on chats, and rest on video calls. </span>
        <br><br>
        <span class="text-28">Love is forgetting everything around myself and feel -  just that one person; whose presence in your life is the only thing you need.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span class="text-28">Love is worshipping a person, and not finding flaws in them. You never get tired of loving that one person and never get annoyed by them.</span>
        <br><br>
        <span class="text-28">Love is the most powerful expression which can do wonders. Love is pushing each other beyond normal, for mutual betterment. Still confused what love is?</span>
        <br>
        <span class="text-40 m-top-10">LOVE IS SONIA</span>
