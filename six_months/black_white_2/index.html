        <br>
        <div class="text-28">She loves memes more than I do. She shares good content with me almost 10 times a day (or even more). I still remember the day when I was about to start the workout while we were talking, and her last text was "Accha yeh meme dekhte jao". I laughed and found myself lucky to have a girl who has a good understanding of memes.</div>
        <div class="text-28">She's so innocent and pure soul, that after looking at others, she mis-categorizes herself as d*mb. I get hurt when I hear this word from her. I really feel like worshipping her innocence, and at the same time feel lucky to have so simple girl in my life. Deep inside, she fights with herself regularly to be better at the things she feels shy about.</div>
        <div class="text-28">Her carefree attitude and patience towards uncontrollable things prove her to be even more matured than me. I might be making 100 lists and planning stuff but at the end, it's GOD who finally executes things. I knew this before also, but got a much deeper realization of it after meeting her.</div>
        <div class="text-28">She's putting a lot of efforts in making me look better. Even I like to have variety in my wardrobe (just like I ensure variety in everything else), but I never prioritized. Sonia is doing this for me - Yayy!!! </div>
        <div class="text-28">Despite being shy in private, she still submits herself, shows trust and gives me the best of memories. Even an hour spent like this becomes so special that we are able to talk about it for hours, and live those memories for days.</div>
