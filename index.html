Despite both of us being active on Shaadi.com, we still registered at Guru Ramdas Marriage Bureau, Rajouri Garden Gurudwara. Nothing could be better than finding a life-partner directly from a Guru Ghar. On 15th November, father's discussed the Rishta and the families decided to see each other on 21st November.</p>

Both of us were quite expressive and comfortable in written communication (though frequently asking "Samaj aaya? <emoji>😆</emoji>" in between), and talked on phone calls much less frequently. Thanks to lockdown schedule, that we got a lot of free time by saving travel time. On the first weekend, Sonia came to her future home for the first time <emoji>😍</emoji>.

				<p class="story">This was ofcourse one of our special meetings due to various reasons. And the most importan reasons was that we both did twinning and wore exactly same shirts, specially bought online. Travelling to Gurgaon all the way in the evening, doing path together, listening to songs, holding hands were some of the golden moments that are unforgettable. Strolling there, we got some amazing clicks, some awesome selfies, we had delicious food sitting next to each other at Sandhouse Cafe, sneaking chances to cuddle each other. And took some pictures there as well. That was a perfect date! While coming back we had a set of some memorable moments together. This meeting however holds a very special place in our hearts and our personal memoir ofcourse!</p>

				<p class="story">So the day is not very normal when she invites you to her place to spend an entire evening <emoji>😍</emoji>. God also helped in making this extra special by introducing aandhi-toofan just an hour before I had to leave for Sonia's place. First, we planned for a Saturday evening, but because Covid and weekend lockdown (which then got extended to 2 more weeks <emoji>😏</emoji>), we pre-poned the plan and I reached her home 5 minutes before the expected time <emoji>😛</emoji>. After a heavy dose of snacks, we went for a walk on her roof, where the most romantic rain was sprinkling on us. We held hands, bumped into each other delibrately <emoji>🤪</emoji> and talked for sometime before we realized that we were getting wet due to rain. We then went to the 2nd floor, had some coffee, got back to roof and came back to a room on the 2nd floor. We relaxed for sometime and exchanged some super tight hugs. We also had some most special, intimate & deepest moments, worth cherishing till the next time we meet. Both of us internally knew that we won't be meeting too soon after this meeting (Because: FUCK YOU COVID <emoji>🖕</emoji>). I also played harmonium in this room (some random Hindi/Punjabi songs), and again had some good moments before getting back to dinner. I was super full after the dinner and could sense food till my throat (before I took some dakaars). Then I went back to my home. Some of the bestest moment with my besteeeeeeesttttt person:

We were so much fond of seeing each other, being with each other and feeling the presence that it felt very difficult at first. But at the end, you have to bear it (right?).

				<p class="story">I wanted to surprise Sonia (Is this a Surprise or Gift @Sonia? <emoji>😝😝</emoji>) with a special message, which I spent 2-3 days writing (in small intervals, as things came to my mind). On reading, she was completely blown and speechless. This was the special message:</p>
				<p class="story"><i>So finally we've completed the 5th month together<emoji>❣️</emoji>. Sounds like a very long journey, no? A simple person like me (or you) had never expected to run a relationship before marriage like this (right?). But this is how it was meant to be <emoji>😜</emoji>. I'm so blessed to have you babes (<emoji>❤️</emoji>), that it is impossible to express this by any means <emoji>💋💋💋💋💋💋</emoji>. Mere Karam itne achhe to bilkul Nahi the jitni acchi ladki babaji ne mujhe di hai. Jitna shukaraana Kara jaaye Kam hai, Kam hai <emoji>🙏🙏🙏</emoji>.<br><br>

				Coming to you - you are the best combination of the loveliest, cutest, charming, lively, moody, sensible, matured, religious, educated and cute puppy-faced person I've ever met <emoji>💘</emoji>. I'm so excited to start the big journey with you, that I dream the same regularly <emoji>😇🥰</emoji>.<br><br>

				Listing some less significant things, which might affect you:<br>
				1. You might think that being less expressive physically is an issue, but this has its own benefits. When you express even a little, it's rewarding for me, I feel like I've got something, I've been gifted a kiss, a hug, or something from my beloved <emoji>😘😘😘</emoji><br>
				2. You sometimes get moody and later realize the same, whereas I act normal/sane almost everytime. I know that this is intermittent. I understand such swings (be it health related or normal mental swings). I call myself impatient but internally I've got a lot of patience in handling such situations. Life and relationships are much beyond such small issues (not sure if this deserve to be called even an *issue*). Also, I wrote before also: *My ego is of much lower magnitude than the depth of our relation*. What we need to always preserve for each other is *self-respect*.<br><br>

				Now the things that matter:<br>
				1.<emoji>💗💗💗</emoji>I LOVE YOU <emoji>💗💗💗</emoji>. Saying this is important - regularly, repeatedly, verbally, face-to-face, everytime and everywhere.<br>
				2. A day without doing deep talks with you / praising you / sharing a lyrics card with you is a *day wasted*. A day is probably a bigger unit of time. I want to talk every hour, minute and second but din mei kaam karna, nahana, sona, hagna bhi zaruri hai <emoji>😝</emoji>, so this is clichèd. I want to talk to you more and more, beshak baat karne k liye <emoji>🔔</emoji>ho.<br>
				3. When we are in private and we open the 🎹, I'm already so much lost in you and in the moment, that I hardly remember songs to play. I've never felt that lost anytime, anywhere else <emoji>😵</emoji>.<br>
				4. As I've noticed more recently, you are becoming more open with me in the things we talk, and questions we ask. So the comfort is slowing coming-in and I'm loving it completely.<br><br>

				On this 5th month anniversary, I feel I've made the right choice, and filled my life with real happiness. Always remember, that I want to have a comfortable life with you and I regularly check for your comfort in anything I do (even when you don't speak up). But given the fact that I'm also a human, you might need to tell me a few things when you're not seeing things upto-the-mark, or when you feel that my feedback system isn't working well. Basically, mereko bhi tokna pad skta hai <emoji>😛</emoji>and you are the only one in the world who has all the rights to do this. Not my parents, sister, or friends, this right is exclusive to you <emoji>💞</emoji>.<br><br>

				Forever yours (*atleast* in this lifetime),<br>
				Gagan (a.k.a Sonia ka aashiq <emoji>💘</emoji>)</i></p><br>

				<p class="story">Again, a phase of sadness started as we heard rise in COVID cases, or news of a friend loosing a relative. Above everything, this was vacations time for Sonia and she was hell bored. We knew that it doesn't make sense to even convince our parents to let us meet because of the situation, but from inside we were DYING to meet <emoji>🥺</emoji>. I wanted Sonia to come to my place, but because of very obvious concerns, Daddyji was wanting me to come (I was shy as this was 3rd consecutive time I was going <emoji>🙈</emoji>). Daddyji followed the professional way and reached out to Papa directly, where Papa said that I'll come if Covid situation improves (as it was already improving when elders were doing the call). Matlab andar se toh mere bhi ladoo foot rahe the and it was not-so-convincing to know on a Monday, that I'll be going to see her on Sunday <emoji>🥺</emoji>(6 din BC?). But I was happy that I'm getting to see her. We also had a major argument on a very very infinitesimally small thing, and I repeat, none of us should stoop that low again (in an argument)<emoji>😊😇</emoji>.
				</p>

				<p class="story">Some photos from the video calls we had during these three weeks (I know you hate these random photos, but you should have a few reasons to hate me too <emoji>😜</emoji>, and zada bolegi to isse bhi gandi photos h mere pass <emoji>🤣</emoji>)</p>

				<p class="story">So again I was invited on 23rd May, as the cases were continuously declining. And this time I reached around 5:28PM to spend more quality time with my Love. This time, as Sonia didn't go out for 40+ days, we also added a bike ride (till Rajouri Garden chownk) in our plan. As usual, I was offered some delicious food and a surprise Grilled Sandwich from Sonia <emoji>😍</emoji> that was Lit AF <emoji>😁</emoji>. We also clicked some photos from Tripod, played with bandminton (not the regular one, but mosquito one), didn't go to the roof (because of bats <emoji>🥵</emoji>), still had plenty fun. For the private time, we stressed more on simplicity of acts rather than variety of it, and it turned out to be super awesome for us <emoji>😇🥰</emoji>. I was also given a nice love letter by Sonia, which I got through a treasure hunt <emoji>😋</emoji>. Apart from keeping that in the TV drawer with our other gifts, I also designed a poster version of it. Here are some super lovely photos <emoji>💋💋</emoji>.</p>
