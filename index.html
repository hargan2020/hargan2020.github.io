Despite both of us being active on Shaadi.com, we still registered at Guru Ramdas Marriage Bureau, Rajouri Garden Gurudwara. Nothing could be better than finding a life-partner directly from a Guru Ghar. On 15th November, father's discussed the Rishta and the families decided to see each other on 21st November.</p>

Both of us were quite expressive and comfortable in written communication (though frequently asking "Samaj aaya? <emoji>😆</emoji>" in between), and talked on phone calls much less frequently. Thanks to lockdown schedule, that we got a lot of free time by saving travel time. On the first weekend, Sonia came to her future home for the first time <emoji>😍</emoji>.

				<p class="story">This was ofcourse one of our special meetings due to various reasons. And the most importan reasons was that we both did twinning and wore exactly same shirts, specially bought online. Travelling to Gurgaon all the way in the evening, doing path together, listening to songs, holding hands were some of the golden moments that are unforgettable. Strolling there, we got some amazing clicks, some awesome selfies, we had delicious food sitting next to each other at Sandhouse Cafe, sneaking chances to cuddle each other. And took some pictures there as well. That was a perfect date! While coming back we had a set of some memorable moments together. This meeting however holds a very special place in our hearts and our personal memoir ofcourse!</p>

				<p class="story">So the day is not very normal when she invites you to her place to spend an entire evening <emoji>😍</emoji>. God also helped in making this extra special by introducing aandhi-toofan just an hour before I had to leave for Sonia's place. First, we planned for a Saturday evening, but because Covid and weekend lockdown (which then got extended to 2 more weeks <emoji>😏</emoji>), we pre-poned the plan and I reached her home 5 minutes before the expected time <emoji>😛</emoji>. After a heavy dose of snacks, we went for a walk on her roof, where the most romantic rain was sprinkling on us. We held hands, bumped into each other delibrately <emoji>🤪</emoji> and talked for sometime before we realized that we were getting wet due to rain. We then went to the 2nd floor, had some coffee, got back to roof and came back to a room on the 2nd floor. We relaxed for sometime and exchanged some super tight hugs. We also had some most special, intimate & deepest moments, worth cherishing till the next time we meet. Both of us internally knew that we won't be meeting too soon after this meeting (Because: FUCK YOU COVID <emoji>🖕</emoji>). I also played harmonium in this room (some random Hindi/Punjabi songs), and again had some good moments before getting back to dinner. I was super full after the dinner and could sense food till my throat (before I took some dakaars). Then I went back to my home. Some of the bestest moment with my besteeeeeeesttttt person:

We were so much fond of seeing each other, being with each other and feeling the presence that it felt very difficult at first. But at the end, you have to bear it (right?).

				<p class="story">I wanted to surprise Sonia (Is this a Surprise or Gift @Sonia? <emoji>😝😝</emoji>) with a special message, which I spent 2-3 days writing (in small intervals, as things came to my mind). On reading, she was completely blown and speechless. This was the special message:</p>
				<p class="story"><i>So finally we've completed the 5th month together<emoji>❣️</emoji>. Sounds like a very long journey, no? A simple person like me (or you) had never expected to run a relationship before marriage like this (right?). But this is how it was meant to be <emoji>😜</emoji>. I'm so blessed to have you babes (<emoji>❤️</emoji>), that it is impossible to express this by any means <emoji>💋💋💋💋💋💋</emoji>. Mere Karam itne achhe to bilkul Nahi the jitni acchi ladki babaji ne mujhe di hai. Jitna shukaraana Kara jaaye Kam hai, Kam hai <emoji>🙏🙏🙏</emoji>.<br><br>

				Coming to you - you are the best combination of the loveliest, cutest, charming, lively, moody, sensible, matured, religious, educated and cute puppy-faced person I've ever met <emoji>💘</emoji>. I'm so excited to start the big journey with you, that I dream the same regularly <emoji>😇🥰</emoji>.<br><br>

				Listing some less significant things, which might affect you:<br>
				1. You might think that being less expressive physically is an issue, but this has its own benefits. When you express even a little, it's rewarding for me, I feel like I've got something, I've been gifted a kiss, a hug, or something from my beloved <emoji>😘😘😘</emoji><br>
				2. You sometimes get moody and later realize the same, whereas I act normal/sane almost everytime. I know that this is intermittent. I understand such swings (be it health related or normal mental swings). I call myself impatient but internally I've got a lot of patience in handling such situations. Life and relationships are much beyond such small issues (not sure if this deserve to be called even an *issue*). Also, I wrote before also: *My ego is of much lower magnitude than the depth of our relation*. What we need to always preserve for each other is *self-respect*.<br><br>

				Now the things that matter:<br>
				1.<emoji>💗💗💗</emoji>I LOVE YOU <emoji>💗💗💗</emoji>. Saying this is important - regularly, repeatedly, verbally, face-to-face, everytime and everywhere.<br>
				2. A day without doing deep talks with you / praising you / sharing a lyrics card with you is a *day wasted*. A day is probably a bigger unit of time. I want to talk every hour, minute and second but din mei kaam karna, nahana, sona, hagna bhi zaruri hai <emoji>😝</emoji>, so this is clichèd. I want to talk to you more and more, beshak baat karne k liye <emoji>🔔</emoji>ho.<br>
				3. When we are in private and we open the 🎹, I'm already so much lost in you and in the moment, that I hardly remember songs to play. I've never felt that lost anytime, anywhere else <emoji>😵</emoji>.<br>
				4. As I've noticed more recently, you are becoming more open with me in the things we talk, and questions we ask. So the comfort is slowing coming-in and I'm loving it completely.<br><br>

				On this 5th month anniversary, I feel I've made the right choice, and filled my life with real happiness. Always remember, that I want to have a comfortable life with you and I regularly check for your comfort in anything I do (even when you don't speak up). But given the fact that I'm also a human, you might need to tell me a few things when you're not seeing things upto-the-mark, or when you feel that my feedback system isn't working well. Basically, mereko bhi tokna pad skta hai <emoji>😛</emoji>and you are the only one in the world who has all the rights to do this. Not my parents, sister, or friends, this right is exclusive to you <emoji>💞</emoji>.<br><br>

				Forever yours (*atleast* in this lifetime),<br>
				Gagan (a.k.a Sonia ka aashiq <emoji>💘</emoji>)</i></p><br>
				<p class="story">Along with this message, there were these two photos <emoji>😘😘</emoji></p>

				<p class="story">Again, a phase of sadness started as we heard rise in COVID cases, or news of a friend loosing a relative. Above everything, this was vacations time for Sonia and she was hell bored. We knew that it doesn't make sense to even convince our parents to let us meet because of the situation, but from inside we were DYING to meet <emoji>🥺</emoji>. I wanted Sonia to come to my place, but because of very obvious concerns, Daddyji was wanting me to come (I was shy as this was 3rd consecutive time I was going <emoji>🙈</emoji>). Daddyji followed the professional way and reached out to Papa directly, where Papa said that I'll come if Covid situation improves (as it was already improving when elders were doing the call). Matlab andar se toh mere bhi ladoo foot rahe the and it was not-so-convincing to know on a Monday, that I'll be going to see her on Sunday <emoji>🥺</emoji>(6 din BC?). But I was happy that I'm getting to see her. We also had a major argument on a very very infinitesimally small thing, and I repeat, none of us should stoop that low again (in an argument)<emoji>😊😇</emoji>.
				</p>

				<p class="story">Some photos from the video calls we had during these three weeks (I know you hate these random photos, but you should have a few reasons to hate me too <emoji>😜</emoji>, and zada bolegi to isse bhi gandi photos h mere pass <emoji>🤣</emoji>)</p>

				<p class="story">So again I was invited on 23rd May, as the cases were continuously declining. And this time I reached around 5:28PM to spend more quality time with my Love. This time, as Sonia didn't go out for 40+ days, we also added a bike ride (till Rajouri Garden chownk) in our plan. As usual, I was offered some delicious food and a surprise Grilled Sandwich from Sonia <emoji>😍</emoji> that was Lit AF <emoji>😁</emoji>. We also clicked some photos from Tripod, played with bandminton (not the regular one, but mosquito one), didn't go to the roof (because of bats <emoji>🥵</emoji>), still had plenty fun. For the private time, we stressed more on simplicity of acts rather than variety of it, and it turned out to be super awesome for us <emoji>😇🥰</emoji>. I was also given a nice love letter by Sonia, which I got through a treasure hunt <emoji>😋</emoji>. Apart from keeping that in the TV drawer with our other gifts, I also designed a poster version of it. Here are some super lovely photos <emoji>💋💋</emoji>.</p>

					Is there anything special than meeting after 2 weeks? That too at my place after a long time? That too on our 6th month anniversary?<emoji>😍😍</emoji> Since we realized that we've spent so long and peaceful time together, both of us started planning some surprises for this special day. Fast forward to the day, it started around 3:45 PM when I picked Sonia from her place and we headed to Gurudwara Moti Bagh Sahib, which is always less populated than other historical Gurudwaras<emoji>🙏</emoji>. We listened to Gurbani Kirtan for sometime, till Komal and Param reached to meet us on our special day. We clicked some photos. Later we headed back to home and they headed to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib.<emoji>😇</emoji>
				</p>
				<img src="img/06jun2021_motibagh.png" class="black-border-500px-img"><br>

				<p class="story">After heading home, we had some juice<emoji>🍺🍺</emoji> and headed to our room to explore our gifts. Sonia had got a beautiful show-piece that was a couple with positivity qoutes written on it.<emoji>🥰</emoji></p>
				<img src="img/06jun2021_show_piece.jpeg" class="black-border-500px-img"><br>

				<p class="story">Then we went back to ground floor, ordered Rolls, and did Paath. By the time we ended Chaupai Sahib, the rolls guys came and I stopped Paath to explain the location to Faasoos delivery guy. We completed Paath and went ahead to cut the cake, exclusively made by my Sonia<emoji>🎂🎂🎂</emoji></p>

				<p class="story">After eating, we went to our roof to play badminton, which was thoroughly enjoyed (game kaafi decent jamm rahi thi beech beech me). After 20ish minutes, we started sweating alot and we came back. We went to our bedroom, dried sweat, had some hugs and special moments which are hard to pen down. Both of us planned little little things for this special day and those were executed so well. It was a great time together - listening songs and getting lost into each other and unleashing some very very special moments. <emoji>💋😍🥰</emoji></p>

				<p class="story">After relaxing, we came down and had dinner together (in the same plate!), had our Cornettos, some walk, and headed back to Sonia's home. Sonia took the charge of riding her future scooty, while I couldn't hug her properly because of the photo I was holding. Overall, it was the pure yet most special meeting, and a perfect anniversary celebrated. <emoji>🤟🤝👍</emoji></p>

				<p class="story">Our first Foody of drive together <emoji>😍😍</emoji>. Our aim on this day was to taste little bit of a lot of things, but pet to hamara chunnu sa hi hai <emoji>😝🙈</emoji>. Though we couldn't click any super-good photos that day, as we were sitting in the car and we've never captured some good car shots. Muje to photos theek lagi, though Sonia ko pasand ni aai <emoji>😋</emoji>. After picking her around 6:30PM from a shop near Gurudwara Bhatta Sahib, we reached 3d Foodz near my home but through a longer route to spend more time together. After having some super lazeez Tandoori momos and Manchurian (yeh super spicy the, agle din subah feel hua [peeche se]), we went for a drive. We touched Sadar bazar Delhi cannt red light and came back, still it was just 7:20PM or so <emoji>🤣</emoji>. We wanted to spend more time together but had less options because sit-in was not an option and we were quite full with the snacks we had. Still we managed some space for a plate for Chilly potatoes (which were also spicy for me, not for Sonia, pta nahi kya hai yeh ladki <emoji>😝😝</emoji>). We had these from a new Shop (Singh's) but these were super tasty and super fast in preparation (less than 10 mins AFAIR). While eating this and talking about ice-cream, Sonia said she wants to have a mango bar, no fancy ice-cream. Just a lane after crossing the Fateh nagar redlight, I spotted a Kwality walls ki redi and we stopped there. We planned to walk while eating in the lanes of Fateh Nagar but Babaji sent some aandhi for us <emoji>😋</emoji> and we had no option than to return back and eat in our car (while writing this, I just realized that I've not cleaned the car even once. Though we didn't throw anything inside while eating, but still.). After eating ice-cream, it was still 8:40 or so. We decided to head back to our homes and I dropped Sonia around 8:55 to the same spot. We had less options for some personal stuff but we still managed <emoji>🤭🤫</emoji>. Overall, like every other meeting, this was something new we tried due to the COVID situation and it wasn't a bad idea. Eating in a restaurant is always preferrable if available, but this is also doable once in a while <emoji>😇</emoji>. Are, kahani likhte hue photos to dalna bhul hi gya <emoji>😜</emoji>.</p>

					As lockdown related restrictions eased, families decided to do wedding related shopping together and planned to go to Chandani Chownk. It was a sunny saturday and we 8 took metro and reached our first shop around 1pm. After showing some Jatto wale and common rang, we got to see some very new, english colors in both gowns and lehenga choli, out of which Sonia and all the ladies finally chose both the pairs for her. Apart from that, we also did a lot of other shopping for Sonia, mum and ofcourse, Bhuaji <emoji>😏</emoji>. After that we all ate chhole bhature, lassi and headed back for our homes. It was quite a tiring day, not just because of shopping but also because of mode of transportation there. But this was a super special day because we purchased stuff for our functions <emoji>😍😍😍😍</emoji>. We talked quite less at night because both of us were hell exhausted <emoji>😩</emoji>.

					Another day of meeting my love, and another day of shopping. We decided to shop a few non-traditional things for Sonia. And she was also excited to see the collection at Goyalsons. We started the day around 12:30PM and shopped some very nice dresses for her. After that, we wanted to have buffet lunch at BBQ company, but bhagwan ne hamari kismat me Buffer lunch kaha likha hai <emoji>😓</emoji>. It was occupied completely due to someone's pre-booked program. So back to basics - we went to Tikka Junction (yes, third time in 6 months) and had some nice snacks there. The bhatti chaamp tikka is just LIT AF. Not to forget, their green chutney brings me tears. The place is overall nice, almost empty, pocket friendly and serves tasty food <emoji>🤑😻</emoji>.

				This meeting was a special one <emoji>😘🤩🥳</emoji>. We had to shop accessories for Sonia's dress + nightsuits for the gareeb (i.e. me <emoji>👻</emoji>). We mistakenly left the dupatta of ring dress at home, so we had to first come home and try the tripod stand <emoji>😋😛😝</emoji>. It was too hot outside so we spent few minutes at home, which became super special <emoji>😘😘</emoji>. Then we clicked some nice photos and went to shop. After coming back, having some snacks and doing paath, we went to see my clothes for functions. Surprisingly, we finalized both of them in 15-20 minutes <emoji>😁</emoji> and went for the dinner finally. Kadimi was much crowded than last time but we got a table (with sofa side, yayy <emoji>🤪</emoji>). We had only few snacks and left for Sonia's home. I remember for most of the way, I was riding with one hand and holding her hand with another <emoji>😍</emoji>. Kisses and hugs are good, but sometimes such things are unmatchable <emoji>💯</emoji>.

				Finally, without going to any bengali baba, our passport appointment date came (after few reschedules). Surprisingly, we got free from there very early, and came home after which we went to my tailor to give naap. From there also, we got free early and as we planned, we went to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib (second time since roka) to seek blessings. Not only the passport date, this was 7th month anniversay of our Roka, so the day was anyways special. Both of us had taken full day leave from respective workplaces. After listening to some blissful Katha, we had some langar. By his grace, this was the first time when we had gurudwara langar <emoji>😇</emoji>. We clicked some photos on the way (and ofcourse made boomerangs <emoji>😛</emoji>). We reached our homes at around 4:30 or 5:00 and spent rest of the day talking <emoji>😎</emoji>.

			<p class="story">Since a long time our parents were planning to call Komal and Jeeju at their home, because Komal had not met them. Finally, we planned a dinner with them and our parents. We reached on 2 wheelers and I'm not glad we didn't bring a car. There was so much traffic everywhere <emoji>🥵</emoji>. I could have managed to reach sooner but Papa was getting stuck in traffic again and again, and I was waiting from them (seeing them through side mirror). We reached home and got a very respectful welcome by our parents <emoji>😇</emoji>, but my bae was missing. She took more than 20-25 mins to come back and looked little tensed. Later I learnt she ordered my favorite dish, but due to some issues, the delivery guy went and was rude to her. But who needs different varities of food on the table, when there's so much love and respect all around? <emoji>😍</emoji>. We had tasty tasty food prepared by mum and went to the 2nd floor to have some hawa. We had a tight hug for a few seconds as everyone was busy downstairs<emoji>😋</emoji>. Then we clicked some photos, had dinner, ice-cream and went back to the roof with everyone, talking about how the girl's original home changes as she gets married and his brother's wife comes to her home. Little did we realize that it was 11:20PM. We went back to our homes after that. We didn't talk that night, as it was already midnight by the time we reached. Sonia was busy cleaning the kitchen, I wrote a good night and went to sleep. It was a super special day. Almost everytime we get to express love and intimacy in a newer, special, and more beautiful way. By the time I'm writing this, I understand that some arguments happen b/w us, but those hardly matter. I super duper eagerly wait to spend my life with my awesome girl <emoji>😍🥰😘</emoji></p>

			<p class="story">By this time, that dumb tailor completed only one suit for Sonia and also did some alteration in her gown, which got fit on her. We planned to go to Rustique previously, then dropped it due to hot weather. We thought we should go to a mall, something nice as DLF Promenade Vasant Kunj. After reaching, we also realized that we never went to a mall together. So there was a lot of scope to talk, walk, eat and click, than just going to a restaurant and eating <emoji>😋</emoji>. We did our paath on the way and reached around 6:15. After parking, Sonia started searching for the mall out of those connecting malls, where she had been in 2019, repeatedly saying "Yeh woh wala nahi hai, koi aur tha" <emoji>😝</emoji>. Thanks to Sarika for comfirming that we were sitting in the correct food court <emoji>😆</emoji>. We had some normal snacks at McD and started clicking some nice pics. Out of juggard, we also used one pillar with Sonia's purse to click some nice full photos of us. Those were some really lovely photos we got. After that we searched for a place to sit. Big Chill was quite a hyped place, but with a waiting till 9:45PM, aur hum to itna rukne se rahe <emoji>😉</emoji>. We sat in cafe, which served a little authentic pasta (with desi tamatar <emoji>😆</emoji>) and an average tasting pizza, 75% of which we got packed (easing maths for you, 6 out of 8 slices is 75% <emoji>😂</emoji>). On the way back, we rested on each other's shoulders on a redlight, which I'm sure, was longer than a minute. That too felt super special. It feels good that in about 105 days, we'll be together and we'll be doing all these great things daily, or even every minute <emoji>😍</emoji>. Love you babes for everything <emoji>💋💋💋💋</emoji></p>
